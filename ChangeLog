in 2013 disassembled Brad's genera to locate and fix the integer division
	code. Located and binary patched it - integer division works ok.
Oct 2014 eventually located the vlm source code and began to work on it.
in 2014	changed stub/process.lisp to work with clisp
	implemented rational division as "asm" operation in
	alpha-emulator/imacmath.lisp and stub/process.lisp
	implemented double-float trap as "c" code in
	alpha-emulator/imactrap.lisp and stub/process.lisp
	implemented networking using a tap interface for internet
	as well as chaos in life-support/network-tap-linux.c.
	floor/ceiling/round produce erroneous results - fixed them by
	introducing new "pseudo" alpha-ops and generating code in
	stub/process.lisp to make use of the libm-functions
	floor, ceil, trunc, and rint functions.
in 2015	implemented check for and workaround for X11 with xcb in
	life-support/cold-load.c and life-support/console.c
	changed keyboard detection code and key translation for
	the cold-load/debugger window in life-support/cold-load.c
	changed timing in life-support/signals.c and utilitites.c
	implemented nfs version 3 client in LISP.
	implemented a server for the "MINI" protocol in LISP,
	patched qld and friends to be able to do a cold load
	using two OG2 instances. Finally able to do a cold-load.
	Still looking for the cold-load generator sources...
	Implemented a few additions to the embedded communication
	area (cwd, home dir), added block-size setting for FEP-disks,
	added unix crypt as a callable routine. Did some changes to
	gc routines to be able to gc even more areas. Succeeded in
	saving worlds smaller then the original 8-5 world.
Aug 2016 made a version of genera work on the alpha using the
	original alpha-assembly generation, fixed some glitches
	when shutting down genera (move termination of network in front
	of all other termination routines). moved to the x64 version as well
Oct 2016 added alpha assembly instruction in alpha-emulator/imactrap.lisp
	to correctly identify double-float traps. Tested on alpha, then
	also moved to the x64 version.
Nov 2016 worked on the chaosnet network module for Linux 'til
	Nov 2017
Nov 2017 moved the source tree into an autoconf/automake project
	fixed a lot of compilation warnings
Feb 2018 cleaned up the sources
	reverted useless code changes in emulator/interface.c
04/21/18 added <dev>:MAC|aa:bb:cc:dd:ee:ff to network options on
	request from Jean Marangos. This is an additional option for the
	interface and is used for CHAOS as well as INTERNET interfaces. By
	default the tap interface code will generate a new MAC address for
	the OG2 end of the tap tunnel each time genera is started.
04/24/18 developed a LISP patch to use the hosts time at startup instead
	of asking around on the network
04/26/18 added "host=address" option to network specifications, so a
	network specification could now look like
	"tap0:INTERNET|192.168.2.2;gateway=192.168.2.1;host=192.168.2.1",
	for example or
	"tap0:CHAOS|401;host=777". By default the tap interface code
	assumes its host is ".1" on the guests subnet for ip, or "377" on the
	guest subnet for chaos. Giving the "host=" option will override
	this default, should you ever need it. I you give the host option
	the address used should be the same address you've used when you
	configured the tap interface.
	added some of the LISP patches I use to the OG2-patches directory
04/27/18 removed "while (1);" from vpunt() to allow termination after an
	error
04/28/18 use ucontext_t instead of struct ucontext in emulator/interfac.c
	and emulator/memory.c as reported by Seth Morabito
	added extern definitions for fixtfloat, _ADDS, _SUBS, _MULS, _DIVS
	as those caused gcc hickups on Ubuntu reported by Seth Morabito
	bumped version to vlm-0.99-1
04/29/18 fixed a bug in life-support/disks.c where passing a negative
	blocksize lead to non-logical blocksize settings
