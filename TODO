plans for further development:

- reconsider using the tap interface using a different method to pick up /
  inject eth frames. A pf interface (BSD-like) isn't available for LINUX
  in a usable fashion like on the alpha ?? maybe try and use libpcap

- clean up the life-support routines (partly done)

- move everything into an autoconf/automake project (partly done,
  working at least)

- instead of generating c-code maybe generate x64 assembly code directly -
  not much performance gain to be expected and lots of tedious work.
  with gcc, c-code is performant anyway...

- build a time routine to be used instead of querying the network for
  universal time at startup. At least with ip this is still taking ages at
  startup, using chaosnet is faster, using a builtin routine would even be
  faster than that. Also find a way to get the DST from the embedding system
  because the LISP code used to dtermine DST is outdated and anyway only
  working for US DST definitions.

- add an option for setting the guest MAC address like
  "tap0:MAC|01:02:03:04:05:06" to utilities.c and life-support/network-tap...
  probably needed to set a MAC address for MACSYMA key generation
